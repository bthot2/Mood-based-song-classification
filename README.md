# Mood-based-song-classification
Aim to classify the give track of music into mood such as happy, sad, peaceful and angry. Songs are collected from 1000 songs database. These samples are imputed to MIR Toolbox, a MatLab package to extract the song features. The script for extracting the features in included in mir_scripts.docx. Once the features are extracted based on their arousal, valence values and Russel’s Simplified Circumflex Model moods are manually assigned to each track. Entire data is placed in data.csv file. Classifiers such as Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines and Decision trees. Dimensionality reduction techniques like LDA and PCA are used to improve the performance.
